### The wanton disposal of plastic led us to think of an incentive-based system.

## What is Kachara Seth?
Waste Disposal is a huge problem that affects climate change directly. It's
estimated that around 55 percent of global plastic waste was discarded, 25
percent was incinerated, and only 20 percent was recycled. Now our project aims
to inspire people, give them a certain incentive in order to recycle their
garbage. Our project KachraSeth.Co is a reward-based system to encourage people
to recycle.

Waste Disposal is a huge problem that affects climate change directly. It's

## What it does
Our project aims to inspire people, give them a certain incentive in order to
recycle their garbage. Our project Kachra Seth.Co is a reward-based system to
encourage people to recycle.

## How we built it
We used A Machine Learning Model to Classify The Garbage. The device sends the
data to a MySql database where our website pulls data from. The web app was
built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Google Charts and amCharts
APIs.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to assemble the hardware into a small form was one of the most
difficult parts. We wanted the hardware to be cost effective and light-weight.
We are most proud of the UI/UX design that animates upon loading, giving the app
a modern feel.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a project which helps our environment and community.
- Working in unison despite being far away from each other.
- Completing this awesome project within very short amount of time.

## What we learned
- We have learnt using `Firebase` with `NodeMCU` Board to send Data to MySQL
  Server ,
- Explored Some cool data visualization Softwares over Website `Amchart`, etc

## What's next for KacharaSeth:
We have already included a location script in order to identify which garbage
comes from where. This data can be sent to the government officials which will
help them to identify localities with garbage type and in turn help them set up
waste disposal systems at such places.
